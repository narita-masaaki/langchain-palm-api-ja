    "\n",
    "### 重要なベストプラクティス\n",
    "\n",
    "思考の連鎖から良いパフォーマンスを得るには、これらのベストプラクティスに従う必要があります。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 小さなLLMを**使用しない**でください。\n",
    "  * 理想的には、少なくとも15BパラメーターのLLMを使用します。\n",
    "  * 蒸留や改良されたLLMアーキテクチャのような技術が、最終的にこのアドバイスを変えることを期待したい。\n",
    "1. 思考の連鎖の前に答えを書くのではなく、思考の連鎖の後に答えを書く。\n",
    "1. [温度](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/start/quickstarts/api-quickstart#try_text_text_prompts)を0に設定する。\n",
    "1. ワンショットやゼロショットだけでなく、数ショットの思考連鎖を使うこと。\n",
    "1. ステップ・バイ・ステップで推論を話すときに言うことをすべて盛り込んだ模範解答を書くこと。\n",
    "  * 思考の連鎖には自然言語による推論が必要だ。\n",
    "  * 自然言語による推論の代わりに数式を使わない。自然言語を補足するために方程式を加えるのは構わない。\n",
    "1. 思考の連鎖が幻覚を止めると決めつけてはいけない。\n",
    "  * 思考の連鎖はLLMの推論能力を向上させるが、LLMが事実をでっち上げることを止めるわけではない。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 追加のベストプラクティス\n",
    "\n",
    "思考の連鎖から最大限に活用するためのより多くのヒント。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Few-Shotプロンプト作成のDo's and Don'ts\n",
    "Don't 過度にFew-Shot事例の順序にこだわる必要はありません。パフォーマンスに変化はないでしょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 分類タスクは例外です。同じクラスの事例を連続して複数提示しないようにしましょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do Chain-of-Thoughtプロンプトが失敗する箇所を分析し、よくある失敗に対処するためのFew-Shot事例を作成しましょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't 最初から6つ以上のFew-Shot事例を作成する必要はありません。タスクによっては、それ以上の事例が役立つ場合もありますが、多くの場合は不要です。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do 複数のプロンプトエンジニアにそれぞれ最適なプロンプトを作成してもらいましょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 例えば、3つのタスクがあり、3人のプロンプトエンジニアがいる場合、各エンジニアが1つのタスクに集中するよりも、全員が3つのタスクのプロンプトを作成する方が良い結果が得られるでしょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't タスクに必要な推論ステップが1つか2つの場合、Chain-of-Thoughtで結果が改善するとは期待しないでください。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't 事例とタスクの推論ステップ数を厳密に一致させることに気を使いすぎる必要はありません。\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 推論のスタイルや構造を一致させる方が重要です。\n",
    "  * ステップ数を一致させることができればパフォーマンス上の利点がありますが、できなくてもChain-of-Thoughtは依然としてパフォーマンス向上に貢献します。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do LLMをチューニングする際にChain-of-Thoughtを追加しましょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LLMに質問と回答からChain-of-Thoughtによる推論を生成させ、その推論をチューニングデータの回答に追加することができます。\n",
    "  * プロンプトとチューニングは二者択一ではありません。チューニングデータの入力が適切に設計されたプロンプトを含む場合、最適なチューニングモデルパフォーマンスが得られます。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do データ分布に一致する事例を含めましょう。\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 例えば、データがクラスA 80%、クラスB 20%で、5つのFew-Shot事例を作成する場合、4つの事例はクラスA、1つの事例はクラスBにするべきです。\n",
    "  * 分類タスクでは事例の順序が重要になることもありますが、クラス分布を一致させることで順序に対する頑健性が高まります。\n",
    "  * 連続して同じクラスの事例を複数提示しないように注意しましょう。"

      "The play concerns the fate of a married woman, who, at the time in Norway, lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. Despite the fact that Ibsen denied it was his intent to write a feminist play, it was a great sensation at the time and caused a \"storm of outraged controversy\" that went beyond the theater to the world of newspapers and society.\n",

    "## ツールの使用ベストプラクティス\n",
    "\n",
    "上記のプロンプトを実験した場合、おそらく失敗が発生した可能性があります。多くの場合、これはウィキペディアツールが限られているためです。\n",
    "\n",
    "いくつかのベストプラクティスに従うことで、この教育の例よりも堅牢で効果的なツールを構築するのに役立ちます。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do プロンプト内でツールとその使用方法を明確に記述しましょう。\n",
    "  * 理想的なツール使用を示すfew-shot事例を含めましょう。\n",
    "  * 例えば、「doc search」とだけ記述されたツールは、「自然言語クエリを使用して社内文書を検索します。レスポンスは、クエリとの関連性が高い順に並べられた文書名のリストです。」のように記述された同じツールよりもパフォーマンスが低くなります。\n",
    "2. Do ツールの範囲と複雑さを慎重に検討しましょう。\n",
    "  * ツールのAPIがLLMにとって十分にシンプルかどうかを検討しましょう。\n",
    "  * 多くの場合、1つの複雑なツールよりも複数のシンプルなツールの方が効果的です。開発者にとっては単一のAPIであっても、LLMツールとしては複数のツールに分けた方が良い場合があります。\n",
    "  * 例えば、ユースケースでデータベースにアクセスするためにSQLを実行する必要がある場合、LLMを使用してSQLクエリを最初から生成するのではなく、いくつかの個別のSQLテンプレートを個々のツールとして検討しましょう。\n",
    "3. Do ツール出力を構造的および文体的に一貫させましょう。\n",
    "  * ツール出力のバリエーションが少ないほど、LLMがその出力を効果的に使用する可能性が高くなります。\n",
    "4. Do ツール出力を短く、関連性の高いものにしましょう。\n",
    "  * 冗長なツール出力は、LLMの入力長制限に負担をかける可能性があります。\n",
    "  * ReAct論文のWikipediaエージェント実装は素晴らしい例です。Wikipedia記事内を検索し、記事全体ではなく、見つかった用語の周辺のテキストスニペットのみを返します。\n",
    "5. Do エラーを適切に処理しましょう。\n",
    "  * 例外をキャッチし、有用なエラーメッセージを提供しましょう。\n",
    "  * タイムアウトやレート制限などのツール側の問題を管理しましょう。\n",
    "  * few-shot事例でエラー処理を示しましょう。\n",
    "  * ツールが失敗し、次のLLM呼び出しで有用なエラーを提供した場合、LLMは自己修正する可能性があります。\n",
    "6. Do ツール使用プロンプトをチューニングしましょう。\n",
    "  * 様々なツール使用を含むパラメータ効率の良いチューニングセット（わずか10個の例でも）は、パフォーマンスを大幅に向上させることができます。\n",
    "7. Do LLMを呼び出してツールアクションを生成する際の出力長を制限しましょう。\n",
    "  * LLMはツールアクションを超えてテキストを生成し続けます。\n",
    "8. Don't セキュリティを忘れないでください。多くのツール使用パターンはセキュリティリスクを生み出します。\n",
    "  * LLMのツールを介してアクセス可能なものはすべて、敵対的な入力で実験するエンドユーザーに見られる可能性があると想定しましょう。\n",
    "  * LLMのツール呼び出しが悪意のあるものであることはないと想定しないでください。例えば、SQLインジェクションはLLMツールを介して可能です。\n",

    "このノートブックのツールは、これらのベストプラクティスの多くに従っていません。\n",

    "1. プロンプトではWikipediaとは何か、またはその使用方法が説明されていません（ただし、LLMはトレーニングデータからWikipediaが何かを「知って」います）。\n",

The album's title refers to the 1951 comedy film, Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan and also reflects the band's weary bitterness from the trial they were undergoing at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. By the time recording of Bedtime for Democracy had begun, the Dead Kennedys had already played what would be their last concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the release of the record, whose opening track is a cover of David Allan Coe's \"Take This Job and Shove It.\"\u001b[0m\n",
